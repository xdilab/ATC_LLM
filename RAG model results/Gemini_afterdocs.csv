Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge,What are the fundamental principles of flight?,"The fundamental principles of flight are based on physical laws governing the forces acting on an aircraft in flight.

The ailerons are attached to the outboard trailing edge of each wing and move in the opposite direction from each other.",
Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge,How does the center of gravity affect aircraft performance?,"The position of the CG of an aircraft determines the stability of the aircraft in flight.
As the CG moves rearward (towards the tail), the aircraft becomes more and more dynamically unstable.",
Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge,What are the different types of drag experienced by an aircraft?,"There are two basic types: parasite drag and induced drag.
Parasite drag is comprised of all the forces that work to slow an aircraft�s movement.
There are three types of parasite drag: form drag, interference drag, and skin friction.  � 
Induced drag is inherent whenever an airfoil is producing lift",
Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge,How is lift generated according to the handbook?,"Lift is the force that opposes the downward force of weight, is produced by the dynamic effect of the air acting on the airfoil, and acts perpendicular to the flight path through the center of lift (CL) and perpendicular to the lateral axis.  � 
An airfoil is shaped to cause an action on the air, and forces air downward, which provides an equal reaction from the air, forcing the airfoil upward",
Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge,What is the function of the horizontal stabilizer?,"The horizontal stabilizer is part of the empennage, or tail section, of the aircraft.
It is a fixed surface that provides stability about the aircraft�s lateral axis.",
Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge,What is the relationship between angle of attack and lift?,"Lift varies with the AOA and airspeed.
As the AOA increases, lift increases (all other factors being equal).
When the aircraft reaches the maximum AOA, lift begins to diminish rapidly.
This is the stalling AOA, known as CL-MAX critical AOA",
Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge,What are the key components of the aircraft's control system?,"Aircraft control systems consist of primary and secondary systems.
The ailerons, elevator (or stabilator), and rudder constitute the primary control system.
Wing flaps, leading edge devices, spoilers, and trim systems constitute the secondary control system.",
Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge,How is engine performance affected by altitude?,"As altitude increases, air density decreases.
As air density decreases, it reduces:
Power because the engine takes in less air.
Thrust because a propeller is less efficient in thin air.
Lift because the thin air exerts less force on the airfoils. ",
Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge,What is the significance of the four forces of flight?,"The four forces are thrust, drag, lift, and weight.
Understanding how these forces work and knowing how to control them with the use of power and flight controls are essential to flight.  � 
In steady flight, the sum of these opposing forces is always zero",

Maneuverability�the quality of an aircraft that permits it to be maneuvered easily and to withstand the stresses imposed by maneuvers.
Controllability�the capability of an aircraft to respond to the pilot�s control, especially with regard to flight path and attitude.",
Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge,What is the purpose of trim tabs on the aircraft?,"Trim tabs are small, movable portions of the trailing edge of the control surface.
These movable trim tabs, which are controlled from the flight deck, reduce control pressures.  � 
Trim tabs may be installed on the ailerons, the rudder, and/or the elevator.",
Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge,How does weight distribution affect takeoff performance?,"A heavier gross weight results in a longer takeoff run and shallower climb, and a faster touchdown speed and longer landing roll.
Even a minor overload may make it impossible for the aircraft to clear an obstacle that normally would not be a problem during takeoff under more favorable conditions",
Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge,What are the safety measures for preventing spatial disorientation?,"Pilots can prevent illusions and spatial disorientation by:
Understanding the causes of these illusions and remaining constantly alert for them.  � 
Always obtaining and understanding preflight weather briefings.  � 
Before flying in marginal visibility or where a visible horizon is not evident, such as flight over open water during the night, obtain training and maintain proficiency in aircraft control by reference to instruments.  � 
Do not fly into adverse weather conditions or into dusk or darkness unless proficient in the use of flight instruments. If intending to fly at night, maintain night-flight currency and proficiency. Include cross-country and local operations at various airfields.  � 
Ensure that when outside visual references are used, they are reliable, fixed points on the Earth�s surface.  � 
Avoid sudden head movement, particularly during takeoffs, turns, and approaches to landing.  � 
Be physically tuned for flight into reduced visibility. Ensure proper rest, adequate diet, and, if flying at night, allow for night adaptation. Remember that illness, medication, alcohol, fatigue, sleep loss, and mild hypoxia are likely to increase susceptibility to spatial disorientation.  � 
Most importantly, become proficient in the use of flight instruments and rely upon them. Trust the instruments and disregard your sensory perceptions.",
Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge,What is the standard approach procedure for landing?,The document does not include a standard procedure for landing.,
Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge,How does the handbook describe adverse yaw?,"Since the downward deflected aileron produces more lift as evidenced by the wing raising, it also produces more drag.
This added drag causes the wing to slow down slightly.
This results in the aircraft yawing toward the wing which had experienced an increase in lift (and drag).
From the pilot�s perspective, the yaw is opposite the direction of the bank.
The adverse yaw is a result of differential drag and the slight difference in the velocity of the left and right wings",
Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge,What are the recommended weather minima for VFR flights?,"The basic VFR weather minimums for Class G airspace are:
1,200 feet or less above the surface (regardless of MSL altitude):

Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge,What is the significance of ground effect during takeoff and landing?,"During the takeoff phase of flight, ground effect produces some important relationships.
An aircraft leaving ground effect after takeoff encounters just the reverse of an aircraft entering ground effect during landing.
The aircraft leaving ground effect will:
Require an increase in AOA to maintain the same CL.  � 
Experience an increase in induced drag and thrust required.  � 
Experience a decrease in stability and a nose-up change in moment.  � 
Experience a reduction in static source pressure and increase in indicated airspeed.  � 
If, during the landing phase of flight, the aircraft is brought into ground effect with a constant AOA, the aircraft experiences an increase in CL and a reduction in the thrust required, and a �floating� effect may occur.  ",
