Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge,What is the role of the ailerons during flight?,"Ailerons are control surfaces located on the trailing edge of the wings that control the aircraft's roll. [cite: 7] They work by creating a difference in lift between the wings, causing the aircraft to bank. [cite: 7]"
Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge,How does the center of gravity affect aircraft performance?,"The center of gravity (CG) is the point where the aircraft's weight is balanced. [cite: 8] The location of the CG affects the aircraft's stability and controllability. [cite: 8] If the CG is too far forward, the aircraft will be nose-heavy and difficult to control. [cite: 8] If the CG is too far aft, the aircraft will be tail-heavy and unstable. [cite: 8]"

Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge,How is lift generated according to the handbook?,"I do not have access to the handbook, so I cannot answer this question. However, lift is generally generated by the difference in air pressure between the top and bottom of the wing. [cite: 10] The shape of the wing, called an airfoil, causes air to flow faster over the top of the wing than the bottom, creating lower pressure on top and higher pressure on the bottom. [cite: 10] This pressure difference creates an upward force, which is lift. [cite: 10]"

[cite: 15] \n* **Air density:** Lower air density increases stall speed. [cite: 15]"
Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge,How is stability maintained in flight?,"Stability is maintained in flight through the design of the aircraft and the use of control surfaces. [cite: 16] The shape of the wings and tail surfaces, as well as the location of the center of gravity, contribute to the aircraft's inherent stability. [cite: 16] The pilot also uses the control surfaces to maintain stability and control the aircraft's attitude. [cite: 16]"

[cite: 8] If the CG is too far forward, the aircraft will be nose-heavy and require more runway to take off. [cite: 8] If the CG is too far aft, the aircraft will be tail-heavy and may be difficult to control during takeoff. [cite: 8]"
Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge,What are the safety measures for preventing spatial disorientation?,"Spatial disorientation is a condition in which a pilot's perception of their position and motion in space is inaccurate. [cite: 18] This can lead to loss of control and accidents. [cite: 18] Safety measures for preventing spatial disorientation include: \n\n* **Instrument flying:** Relying on flight instruments rather than visual cues in poor visibility conditions. [cite: 18] \n* **Vestibular training:** Training to help pilots interpret the sensations from their inner ear, which can be misleading in certain flight conditions.
